	* diskus.c (dump_worker): forgot an unsigned, so on negative
	characters repeated sequences were not detected.

	* diskus.c (create_sector): Length calculation was with an offset
	of 1.  This never placed the id on the last byte of a sector.  Not
	harmful, but not clean ;)

	* diskus.c (check_worker): bug removed
