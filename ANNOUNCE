Option -jump added (because I needed it)

This feature is very experimental and only works for read modes currently.
It tries to jump over errors by skipping to the next 4096 byte boundary.
It has not been tested thoroughly and if run with the -async option
(which automatically might kick in in several cases) this will behave
a little bit unreliably.
