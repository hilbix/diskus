Reporting corrected

The result printed with -gen mode differed from that with -check mode,
which was really puzzling.  Now both shall show the same counts.

(Previously the read-loop showed the correct count, while the
write-loop showed the count which would be reached if not EOF
interfered, which was too high.)
