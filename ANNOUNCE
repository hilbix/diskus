Bugfix release, better reporting and return value,
Option -quiet to suppress progress status

Diskus previously was not very detailed in the output,
it now prints more information if -quiet is not present.

The "dump" function 0.2.x did no more work correctly if option -expand
was not present, this is fixed now.
