Removed minor bugs.

There was a bug when reading devices without option -async present.
Newer kernels apparently do not allow to do that.  The workaround was
to add the -async option.  This is now automatically applied.

Also if the start value was not a multiple of the sector size strange
things happened.  The start value now is rounded.
