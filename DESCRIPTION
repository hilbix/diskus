This program checks the disk geometry by writing sectors with a
numbered ID to the harddrive.  THIS ERASES ALL DATA ON THE DEVICE!
Later you can verify if the disk got the data correctly.  DISKUS will
then detect if sectors are written wrong (to the wrong position or
with bit errors).

You can also NUL the drive (like dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdwhatever),
just checkread it or do a hexdump.

This is no tool to write bit check patterns to the harddrive or erase
your harddrive according to DOD algorithms.  The difference to dd is,
that this here uses O_DIRECT/O_SYNC and has a little progress meter.
